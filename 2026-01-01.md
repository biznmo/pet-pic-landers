## What's Remaining (TODO)

### High Priority - Need Images

#### Section 4: Product Mockups
Need 5 product images showing actual printed portraits:
1. **Canvas on wall** - Living room setting with canvas portrait
2. **Framed poster** - Office/bedroom with framed print
3. **Multiple sizes** - Comparison of 18x24, 24x36, 28x40
4. **Close-up quality** - Detail shot showing print quality
5. **Packaging/unboxing** - Portrait being unwrapped

**Prompts for image generation:**

```
Canvas Portrait Mockup (Gemini):
Photorealistic interior design photo of a modern living room with a large
canvas pet portrait (golden retriever in regal king style) hanging above
a gray sofa. Warm lighting, tasteful decor, the portrait is the focal point.
Professional real estate photography style.
```

```
Framed Poster Mockup (Gemini):
Photorealistic photo of a home office with a black-framed pet portrait
(cat in pop art style) on a white wall. Minimalist desk setup, natural
window light. The print looks museum-quality and professionally framed.
```

#### Section 7: Gift Reaction Image
Need 1 image showing emotional gift moment:

```
Gift Reaction (Gemini):
Photorealistic photo of a woman in her 30s excitedly holding up a wrapped
canvas pet portrait she just received as a gift. Living room setting,
holiday or birthday atmosphere, genuine surprised/happy expression.
The portrait shows her dog. Candid photography style.
```

### Lower Priority

- [ ] Add actual customer testimonials (Section 5)
- [ ] Add trust badges/payment icons
- [ ] Consider adding video background to hero
- [ ] SEO meta tags optimization
- [ ] Add structured data (JSON-LD)

## Notes

- The main Pet Pic Portraits site is at: https://petpicportraits.com
- This landing page will be deployed separately (subdomain or different domain for ads)
- All AI-generated images should use GPT-image-1 for art styles, Gemini for photorealistic mockups
- The "before" pet photos can be AI-generated (the tabby cat was!) - just needs to look real
